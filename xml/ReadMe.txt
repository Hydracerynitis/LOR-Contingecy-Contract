Inspired by the system of Contingency Contract in Arknights (or Heat in Hades). 
I add a system that you can add multiple Modifiers upon Guest and Librarian. 
Each Modifier (or Contract) will increase the Risk Level. 
When Player complete a stage with enough risk level (12), they will be rewarded with Powerful Equip Page.

For player eager for more difficult endgame challenge. 
The reception of Olivia, the reception of The Blue Reverbration and the Last Reception did not affect with this mod 
This is becuase the build player have in these reception are fixed and can't handle the chaos this mod brought upon

Guide for playing this mod:
Step 1: You can find all available contracts in Contract List.txt in folder ContractList (Other version of supportive language are also included there)
Step 2: Find Contracts you want to challenge and record their codes you. 
Steo 3: Enter a new line in ContractLoader.txt and copy the codes into it before initializing a reception.
        e.g. Input following into ContractLoader.txt in order to Challenge "Surgery enhancement 4","Concussing Strike 4" and "Unflappable"
