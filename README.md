# LORMod-ContingecyContract
A Mod for the game Library Of Ruina

Like Contingency Contract in Arknights (or Heat in Hades), I add a mechanic that you can add multiple Modifiers upon Guest and Librarian. Each Modifier will increase the Risk Level. When Player complete a stage with enough risk level (usually 18), they will be rewarded by unique reword.

It's for player who feel realy confident for more difficult challenge or people who has immense power require a better opposing force
